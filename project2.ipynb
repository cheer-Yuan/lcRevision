In this assignment, you will work through a set of tasks using data for a weighted undirected network where the nodes correspond to regions of the human brain with particular functions, and weighted links indict the density of neuron fiber pathways between regions. You have been provided with the *weight matrix*, $\\rm W$, for the network which is defined as follows: $W_{ij}=0$ indicates that there are no connections between regions $i$ and $j$. If $i$ and $j$ are connected, $W_{ij}$ contains the density of connections which can be considered to be an estimate of how much current can flow between the two regions. The only other information about the human brain that is needed for this assignment is that it consists of two parts, a left and right hemisphere.\n",

The code will compute an $N$-element vector, $\\rm s$ where $s_i=\\pm 1$ and indicates which community node $i$ has been assigned to. The method requires a modification to the definition of the modularity matrix. Let $\\tilde k_i = \\sum_{j=1}^N W_{ij}$, and $\\tilde K = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\tilde k_i$. The modified modularity matrix is defined as: $$\\tilde B_{ij} = W_{ij}-\\frac{\\tilde k_i \\tilde k_j}{\\tilde K}$$. The modified spectral method then requires the following steps:\n",
